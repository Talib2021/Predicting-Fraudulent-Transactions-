# Fraud Detection System

## Overview

The **Fraud Detection System** aims to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The system processes a dataset containing features of financial transactions, including transaction amounts, account details, and other relevant information, and classifies each transaction as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM, to detect anomalies in the data that might indicate fraud.

## Features

- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies fraudulent transactions based on a variety of features.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes different anomaly detection techniques for detecting outliers.
- **Scalable**: The system can handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model effectiveness.
